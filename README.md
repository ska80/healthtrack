# Health Track

Health Track is an app designed to make it as fast and as easy as possible to
record information about your health.

Helps capture:

- Food (Meals, snacks, etc)
- Conditions (bad night sleep, stress, long day at work)
- Symptoms (headaches, pain, etc)
- Activities (exercise, etc)

You may ask, how is this app different from other apps that do things like this? Other apps may do a specific thing well, but they do not make it easy to capture everything. The goal of this app is to be a very good at helping you to record information, and getting out of your way.
